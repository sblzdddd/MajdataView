## About
This project is a WebGL version of [MajDataView](https://github.com/LingFeng-bbben/MajdataView). It directly supports reading maidata.txt in viewer instead of converting into majdata.json by Editor. It is done by adding simai reader codes from MajDataEdit and unity builtin audiosource into project.

## How to use

Go to [MajdataView online page](https://sblzdddd.github.io/majdataview-online) and try it! Or go to [release page](https://github.com/sblzdddd/MajdataView/releases) for the built. (You may need a local server for running it) 

similar to the original MajDataView, you can find hidden buttons on the Top-Right corner of the square screen on the middle. There is a simple menu in the viewer. please upload three files (maidata.txt, track.mp3, bg.jpg) before playing the chart!
